# Stock-Price-Data-Science-Project
I analyzed S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ datasets to create a primitive stock price predictor. 
I used various data analysis and machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. 
I started with cleaning the data, moved on to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and finally experimented with various linear regression models and decision trees to see which ones had the best predictions.
The main purpose of this project was to practically implement the ML models that I learned and to explore a complex data science problem. Even though my final model did not yield high-accuracy predictions, I learned a lot about the processes involved in a typical data science project and some things to look out for!
